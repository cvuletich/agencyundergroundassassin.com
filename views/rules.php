<h1>Rules</h1>
Thank you for your interest in the unsanctioned Agency Underground Assassin Game. Here are the underground official rules that may or may not slowly evolve as needs (or advantage) arise.
Object of the game: The aim of the game is for players to track down and eliminate their targets until only one player remains. When a player eliminates their target, they get the victim's target(s). Only one assassin can kill a target at a time. If only one player remains, the game is over and bragging victory dances commence.
Timeline
In the beginning of of each week, individual targets are assigned to each assassin. 
Each week will be its own contest and will start on the Monday of that week and end on Friday of that week. Assassinations may only occur from 9:30 am to 5:00 pm each day of the contest.
The games will run for six weeks from January 4th through February 12th.
Items of Gameplay
Assassin weapon
Direct weapons
Indirect weapons
Target name card(s)
Assassin name card
Assassination
Eliminations (“kills”) removes a target from the game for the week. Elimination can occur through direct or indirect means. Once eliminated, the player gives the assassin (or attempted target if they performed the elimination first) their targets and elimination. Eliminations must occur in designated assassination locations. Alas, no head shots of any kind.
Direct weapon eliminations
Direct weapon eliminations occur through use of the following:
Nerf guns using soft projectiles
Rubber-band projectiles
Water guns (light spraying, not fire hydrant or super-soaking quality; so sorry and you have to clean up any incidental mess)
Non-permanent markers used to mark the target’s skin (no marking anything above the shoulders).
Contact by plastic spoon
Contact by a piece of string
Contact by silly string (you are responsible for cleanup)
Placing a sticker on the target (extra bragging points if labeled “R.I.P”, “Righteous Kill” or “Die! Die! Die!”
Direct weapon eliminations must contact the target, not nearby non-targets. If a non-target is contacted by an assassin’s direct method, the assassin is neutralized and the target receives the assassin’s elimination and any targets that the assassin might have. As stated before, no headshots.
If in the assassination attempt, the target is able to eliminate the assassin with first contact, the target receives the assassin’s elimination and any targets that the assassin might have. Elimination of the assassin by the target is eligible only after the assassin has revealed themselves.
If in the assassination attempt the assassin/target breaks the direct weapon (for example a spoon breaks) upon contact, the attempt is nullified. For example: An assassin attempts to eliminate their target with a spoon. Upon contact, the spoon breaks (perhaps because of their over-zealousness). The assassin’s attempt is nullified. The target’s defense rules still apply. 
Indirect weapon eliminations
Indirect eliminations can be made by having the target open up a sealed piece of paper notifying them of their assassination and who their assassin is.
If a non-target opens up the sealed piece of paper, the elimination attempt is neutralized and the assassin must use another way to neutralize the target.  
Any weapon ideas must be submitted to HQ for approval.
Assassination Locations and Safety Zones
The Agency Underground Assassin Game can only be played within the agency office. 
Safety Zones within the agency office where assassinations are invalid include:
The target’s designated work desk/work area. If they are in it or can touch it, the target is considered in a safety zone. However, if someone uses their own work desk/work area as an area to assassinate their target, the target may attempt to eliminate the assassin even though the assassin is in their own work desk/work area. 
The studio mount room (there’s knives in there and nobody wants to be assassinated while around knives. Accidents happen that way.)
Anywhere near the recording studios is a HUSH  ZONE! People pay good money to record and edit there and they don’t want to record any accidental blood curdling screams. See map below for a diagram of the affected area.

The mailroom 
The bathrooms (duh…)
Meeting rooms (actual meeting rooms, not just meetings or offices…..)
Private rooms
Elevators
Staircases
Around clients (because it scares the clients and/or encourages them to join.)
Once a target (or assassin if successfully countered) is assassinated, the eliminated player gives the victor their target cards. The victor reports back to agencycloakdagger@gmail.com to record the assassination and claim bragging rights.
If in the attempt of assassination, the assassin gets taken out by the target or through the taking out of an innocent, the person who was the original target becomes the target of the person who had the assassin as a target.
Example:
Assassin 1 targets Assassin 2 targets Assassin 3 targets Assassin 4
Assassin 2 and Assassin 3 somehow get taken out.
Assassin 4 now becomes Assassin 1's target
If these circumstances happen to you, go to your target and find out who their target was to acquire the new target.
